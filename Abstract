#Abstract

I am a child corrupted by the internet. At first, my understanding of the word abstract was heavily influenced by the online world,I interpreted it as “something hard to understand.” But the true meaning of abstraction is the simplification of processes and the extraction of essential ideas.

For example, “Copy Chapter 3 of the Chinese textbook three times” is very concrete. “Copy the Chinese textbook” is more abstract, and “Do homework” is even more abstract. While abstraction generally means simplifying and generalizing, it can also be very concrete in its own way.

Take machine language, for example,a long sequence of 0s and 1s represents an extremely detailed and specific implementation process. However, it’s hard for humans to understand what the computer is actually doing. So we abstract these processes into human-readable terms like “addition,” “subtraction,” or interpret a binary sequence like 1100100 as “100.” These are good examples of how abstraction can also be concrete and clearly defined.

Another example is when I write a few lines of code and wrap them into a function, naming it according to its purpose. This is also a form of concrete abstraction,taking a set of operations and giving them a meaningful label that hides the internal steps while expressing their intended use.
