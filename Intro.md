# Intro

I'm a self-taught "muggle" who stumbled into the world of programming. The articles here are my reflections on this craft, gathered along the way. I hope they can serve as references for other "muggles" like me. If any of my understanding is incorrect, I welcome corrections and appreciate your patience.

My English isn't great. I can manage listening and reading, but when it comes to writing, I rely on AI for translations. You're welcome to communicate in Chinese.
