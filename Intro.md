# Intro

I'm a self-taught "muggle" who stumbled into the world of programming. The articles here are my reflections on this craft, gathered along the way. I hope they can serve as references for other "muggles" like me. If any of my understanding is incorrect, I welcome corrections and appreciate your patience.
Let me know if you'd like any refinements,especially if you'd prefer a different tone or wording!
