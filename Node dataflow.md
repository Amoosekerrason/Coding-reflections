# Node Data Flow

I have a slow learning curve, and in many cases, I need hands-on experience to truly understand the underlying principles—like node-based data flow. When I first encountered this concept on LeetCode, I was puzzled, wondering where it could be practically applied. Then, while working on a game module and using Unreal Engine’s Blueprint system, I suddenly realized that this was precisely what node-based data flow was. Later, when developing a mobile app for a shameless client who didn’t pay, I further grasped that interactions between different classes function much like Unreal Engine’s Blueprint system. They resemble neurons in a nervous system, constantly transmitting information. Peripheral nerves are triggered by events (callbacks), passing signals through neurons (various classes) and returning them to the brain (main) for centralized processing. This collaborative division of labor enhances efficiency and minimizes chaos.
